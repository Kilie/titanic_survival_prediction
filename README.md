# Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning from Disaster
On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. 

The data of this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview), which contains demographic information of the passengers aboard the Titanic, such as survivals, ages, genders, ticket classes, number of siblings/spouses on board, number of parents/children on board, tickect numbers, port of embarkation etc. A detailed list of the variables is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

This project is to analyze which of these demographic features made some passengers more likely to survive than others, and apply machine learning to predict the survival likelihood of Titanic passengers.

# Installation
> Anaconda 3

> Jupyter Notebook 6.0.0
